<p>
My name is Djouher Otmani. I am Kabyle from Algeria, originally from Tizi Ouzou, and I am currently living in Montreal.
I am studying at Algonquin College in the Media Design program, where I am learning the basics of web development.
Through this course, I am discovering how <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> works and why structure and meaning are important in web pages.
I really <em>enjoy</em> learning new digital skills and improving step by step through practice and patience.
</p>

<p>
Moving to Canada has been a meaningful experience for me, both personally and academically.
This program helps me build confidence in creating websites and understanding semantic elements.
I am motivated to continue learning and growing in this field because technology plays a big role in creativity today.
This is my 1<sup>st</sup> semester building a complete HTML page from scratch, and it has been a very positive learning experience.
